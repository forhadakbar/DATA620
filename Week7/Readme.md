# Project 2
## Project Overview  
1. Identify a large 2-node network datasetâ€”you can start with a dataset in a repository.  Your data should meet the criteria that it consists of ties between and not within two (or more) distinct groups.
2. Reduce the size of the network using a method such as the island method described in chapter 4 of social network analysis.
3. What can you infer about each of the distinct groups?
